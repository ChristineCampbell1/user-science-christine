                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        The website <a href="http://www.seattleu.edu/getanswers">seattleu.edu/getanswers</a> is a
                        website designed
                        to provide answers to Seattle University students about the many changes underway regarding
                        Spring Quarter
                        and campus operations while the university operates remotely.</p>
                    <p>
                        The page was recently created and added to the Seattle University website to respond as quickly
                        as possible
                        to questions as new policies were being created, but we want to conduct a usability test to make
                        sure
                        students are able to find the information they are looking for or reach out to informed staff
                        who can help
                        them find answers.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        The usability test of <a href="http://www.seattleu.edu/getanswers">seattleu.edu/getanswers</a>
                        were conducted for both desktop and mobile devices. The desktop tests were on 4/45-26/2020 and
                        they were conducted on the users’ own computers. The mobile tests were conducted on 5/2/2020 on
                        the users’ own mobile device and shared by screen share on Zoom and recorded on Zoom. The tests
                        were conducted in Seattle, WA.
                    </p>
                    <p>The purpose of the tests was to determine whether the website was easy to use and to gauge the
                        look and feel of the site and its organization. The report on solely desktop users can be found
                        in <a href="https://www.campbellgroup.live/user-science-christine/post3.html">last week’s blog
                            post.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>This report will be a combination of the results and recommendations from both sets of users.</p>

                    <p>Three participants conducted the tests. The sessions were short-10 minutes each. Each participant
                        conducted the same tests.
                    </p>
                    <p>The overall results were that the users found the page to contain useful information. However,
                        both types of users experienced some challenges.

                    </p>
                    <p>For desktop users, some guideposts were unclear and users strayed, looking for the right place to
                        find
                        answers. Users also didn’t use some navigation options, like jumps, and instead ended up doing a
                        lot of scrolling.
                    </p>
                    <p>For mobile users, some containers were too large and required a lot of scrolling. Like the
                        desktop users, they also wanted more redundancy on pages as they unsuccessfully looked in
                        related places for information.
                    </p>


                    Recommendations for improvement include: <br>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                        <li>Adding redundancies: Add Emergency Fund information to the Student Financial Services page
                        </li>
                        <li>Clarifying headings: Remove the word FAQ from the phrase “Quick Facts and FAQ” and make a
                            new heading
                            for FAQ right above the FAQ</li>
                        <li>Clarifying navigation: Increase the size of the jump options</li>
                        <li>Elevating links: Make the student support center/get answers page a more prominent feature
                            on the
                            Covid19 page</li>
                        <li>Reducing the size of containers: the “contact” container is too large when viewing on a
                            mobile device
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This blog contains details about the methodology, the participants and the tasks assigned. It
                        summarizes the results and ratings, and concludes with recommendations.

                    <h3>Methodology</h3>
                    <h4>Sessions</h4>

                    <p>
                        The user test sessions happened over the course of a week, with desktop users going first, and
                        concluding with mobile users. Each session was approximately 10
                        minutes in length. Participants were asked to complete 2 tasks and were questioned about 3
                        things: ease of
                        the navigating and finding the information, the overall look and feel and tone of the page, and
                        the organization
                        of the order of things on the page.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Participants</h4>
                    <p>I recruited 6 participants for the user test.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Tasks/Scenarios</h3>

                    <p>Participants were asked questions based on a script. This particular <a
                            href="/files/user test script mobile.pdf">user test script</a> is for mobile testers. This
                        is the <a href="/files/user test script.pdf">desktop user test script.</a> Testers were
                        introduced to the project and then asked to start on the homepage of Seattle U and find the
                        answers to two scenarios, both
                        of which are common questions asked by people who end up emailing or calling the student support
                        center:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                        <li><b>Task 1: Emergency Funds.</b> You are a current college student and you want to know how
                            to apply for
                            emergency funds. What would you
                            do?</li>

                            apply for credit/no credit options for Winter quarter grades. What would you do?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                    <br>

                    Users had mixed results in their tasks.

                    <p>Users found the site a little challenging to use. They liked the look and feel of the site and
                        said it felt
                        like a place for college students. They found the organization could use some improvement.

                    <h3>Recommendations</h3>

                    <p>Users highlight some simple navigation, headings and links changes that can make the site more
                        intuitive.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>


                    <p>
                        Users found the page to be informative and a welcome source to turn to when there are so many
                        policies changing making other recent policy changes outdated. Most users were able to find
                        answers to most tasks but some clearer signposts, smaller sections, and more prominent
                        navigation options will help to make the page a quicker source of information. Implementing the
                        recommendations and continuing to work with both desktop and mobile users (real laypeople) will
                        ensure a user-centered website.
