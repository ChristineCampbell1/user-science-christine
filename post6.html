                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        This week I turn the tables on myself and take a look at how one page of this User Science
                        Journal looks through the lens of <a
                            href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">W3C’s Web Content Accessibility
                            Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)</a>.</p>
                    <p>
                        I randomly chose Blog 3 Usability Tests for this evaluation. Based on this review, the webpage
                        is actually pretty close to meeting WCAG 2.1, Conformance Level AA.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Scope of Review</h3>
                    <p>
                        The webpage reviewed is <a
                            href="https://www.campbellgroup.live/user-science-christine/post3.html">https://www.campbellgroup.live/user-science-christine/post3.html</a>.
                        The web
                        page is written in English.
                        The review was conducted on 5/15/2020.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Purpose of the Site</h3>

                    <p>The purpose of <a href="https://www.campbellgroup.live/user-science-christine/post3.html ">User
                            Science Journal Blog Post 3</a> is to serve as a way to share my learning and thinking as it
                        pertains to user experience. Blog Post 3 was a write up of a usability test of Seattle
                        University’s Student Support Center, as experienced by desktop users.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Review Process</h3>
                    <p>The review process consisted of reviewing the website through <a
                            href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIm’s Web Accessibility
                            Evaluation Tool - WAVE</a> on the accessibility standard of WCAG 2.1. I also manually
                        checked
                        links and forms. The site was evaluated on coding style, assistive attributes, and relative
                        levels of support for different assistive needs.</p>
                    <p>The evaluation results in this report are based on evaluation conducted on 5/15/2020. I have
                        worked to address the errors after running the evaluation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Results and Recommended Actions</h3>

                    <p>This website appears to be close to meeting WCAG 2.1 A, AA, AAA.
                    </p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type:disc"></ul>
                    <li><b>Strengths: </b>Accessibility features in which this site is strong include linked images
                        with alternative text and structural elements including headings, unordered lists and
                        navigation.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Needed improvements:</b> Recommended priorities include addressing inaccessible features of
                        the site include fixing the 4 errors where there are empty links and the 4 contrast errors.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Most of the accessibility issues are in the masthead area, as shown in the image below, and are a
                        result of content I added or removed.
                    </p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post6/banner.png"
                            alt="Image of WAVE evaluation with errors highlighted">
                    </a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Resolving Empty Links</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h4>An empty link where home navigation should be</h4>
                    <p>Below, highlighted in grey, is the line of code that is missing a link.</p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post6/home.png"
                            alt="Image of WAVE evaluation code with errors highlighted">
                    </a>
                    <br>
                    <p>My name was originally in that link, but it was too long and getting in the way of the titles
                        so I took it out as I built out the website. Since it’s really meant to bring you home, and my
                        name is already on
                        the page, I decided to insert “Home” in there, which fixed the empty link issue.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Empty links in social media</h4>
                    <p>The remaining empty links are for the social media links in the footer, as shown below,
                        highlighted by the evaluation.</p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post6/social.png"
                            alt="Image of WAVE evaluation showing empty links in social media">
                    </a>
                    <p>I had been wondering how to add my links to these social media buttons so this was a good
                        time to try to figure it out. I added my personal links to the href line of code, and tested
                        them to make sure they worked. They did!
                    </p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post6/mysocial.png"
                            alt="Image of VSCode with my social links added">
                    </a>
                    <p>But when I ran the page through WAVE again, I was still getting blank label messages so with a
                        little help from my instructor, I learned that I needed to
                        add aria labels, like I did here with Twitter in the image below.</p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post6/aria.png"
                            alt="Image of VSCode with aria code added to my Twitter link">
                    </a>
                    <p>When I reran the page through the WAVE checker, I had solved all of my empty links.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Low Contrast Errors</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Four low contrast errors in the masthead</h4>
                    <p>All four low contrast errors are in the masthead. I have often been frustrated by the dark
                        overlay in
                        this Bootstrap template on the banner images and I can see how that would make reading the
                        headline even harder for screen
                        readers or people with visual impairments. The code below is an example of how WAVE shows where the low visibility issues are showing up, with red boxes.</p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post6/visibility.png"
                            alt="Image of WAVE evaluation code showing low visibilty boxes">
                    </a>
                    <p>In order to fix this, I went into the code for the page header and found the culprit: a div class
                        called overlay. I removed this line of code and it brightened up my banner image.</p>
                    <p>But when I ran the page through the WAVE checker again, it still showed low visibility. I tried a
                        number of other images, using several color contrast checkers to help me choose a new image, and still kept having low visibilty errors. The best combination suggestion for white font seemed to be a green background. I tried a number of green banner images and still had trouble with WAVE. Ultimately, it appears that WAVE has some trouble checking visibility, so I went with what was suggested by the checkers and used
                        a green background, below.</p>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post6/leaf3.png"
                            alt="Image of green leaf in a background banner">
                    </a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>The website for <a href="https://www.campbellgroup.live/user-science-christine/post3.html ">User
                            Science Journal Blog Post 3</a> was already built with accessibility in mind. The issues
                        that arose upon evaluation - empty links and low contrast - were the result of my content
                        additions. The fixes took a bit of time to resolve because I had never encountered them before
                        and needed to learn how to repair them. In the future, I can imagine being able to quickly fix
                        them, and probably won't make those errors again, now that I know they cause problems with accessibility.</p>
